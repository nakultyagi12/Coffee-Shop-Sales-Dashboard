## ðŸ“Œ Process Used in Project

#### 1. **Raw Data Issues Identified**

* `transaction_time` was stored as **text** instead of time format.
* No calculated **revenue** column (needed to be derived using `unit_price Ã— transaction_qty`).


#### 2. **Data Cleaning Steps**

* âœ… Converted `transaction_time` to proper **time format** and extracted **hour** for time-based analysis.
* âœ… Created new column **Total\_Revenue** = `unit_price Ã— transaction_qty`.
* âœ… Ensured all date columns were in **datetime** format for compatibility with slicers and pivot timelines.
* âœ… Standardized text formatting in `store_location`, `product_category`, and `product_detail`.

#### 3. **Data Transformation & Aggregation**

* ðŸ“Š Aggregated total revenue and total quantity:

  * **Per month** (for trend analysis).
  * **By store** (for location-wise performance).
  * **By product and category** (for sales performance).
  *  Extracted hour from `transaction_time` to create "Sales by Hour" line chart.
  *  Extracted weekday from `transaction_date` for "Sales by Weekday" breakdown.
